This repository provides four examples of annotated equations:

1. [example_prob.tex] A simple one inside the equation construct, in a double column format
2. [example_prob2.tex] A more complex one, but this time inside the figure construct in a double column format
3. [example_laplace.tex] Inside the wrapfigure construct but for a single column format
4. [example_overlay.tex] More complicated examples, side-by-side using the minipage construct in a single column format

The folder, "example_output_figs" includes figures that show the outputs of the above four cases.

Note: the main latex file, "eqn_annotate.tex" includes many latex packages and some definitions that are required.
